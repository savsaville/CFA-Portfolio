# As a Class Project for CFA we were given the task to create a portfolio to showcase our present and upcoming work. This was also an opportunity to show our creativity and personality. 

# It was a fairly open ended challenge with only several requirements.
* A thoughtfully written bio.
* Portfolio section for your projects.
* A way to contact you.
* Attitude/Quirkiness
* Hiroku Deployment.   

# I came up with a list of outcomes that I wanted and went to design the wireframes. The outcomes were as follows:
* A clean, clutter-free look.
* An opening photo, an "About me" section, "projects" section, and a contacts section.
* After the intitial photo, I wanted to use icons and boxes to keep it simple.
* Something that was easy to modify when my skills and number of projects increased.
* As I was telling a story, I wanted to have a book effect where every section was a page of a book.

# I drew up a couple of wireframes and went to work.
